# IOE_574_BusSimulation
In a study conducted and published by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), It was shown that Global emissions due to burning of fossil fuels have increased
almost exponentially since 1900. From 1970, there has been more than a 90% increase in
emissions and greenhouse gases, with the emissions from burning fossil fuels and fossil fuel
based combustion contributing to about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions

A natural step for city planners to combat this issue is to explore ways to reduce the
dependency on transportation such as personal cars and other motorized vehicles. One way
that this has been implemented is with the introduction of bike lanes to push the public into
using bikes for intra-city travels. While this may be effective in specific cities and during certain
times of the year, more needs to be done in order to allow people to move from one place to
another. For example, during winter months in Michigan, where people may not want to cycle as
much, may prefer to take the bus to get to their destination. This provides the city planners an
opportunity to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by switching the bus system to either a
hybrid or an all-electric fleet. A report published by The National Resources Defence Council
(NRDC) in 2015 has shown that using either hybrid or electric systems for transportation
systems has the potential to dramatically reduce the lifetime emissions of greenhouse gases by
as much as 77%, which is equivalent to reducing emissions by 1700 million metric tons relative
to 2015 levels.

The aim of this project is to simulate the University bus (or M-Bus) system for the city of
Ann Arbor using 4 different types of buses - conventional buses (liquid fuel based), all electric
buses, and hybrid buses. We aim to aid the city planner in making a decision on which type of
bus would be the most feasible for the given situation. In order to make this decision, we
compare several metrics associated with the operational feasibility of different alternatives
through sensitivity analysis on performance based measures, number of buses in the fleet and
the level of fuel to be maintained at the start of each day. The simulation model proposed in the
paper consists of two parts - a recharging/refilling station (which is modeled in the form a route)
and the actual transportation model itself. The transportation network is in the form of a network
flow and utilizes a start and end node which represent a bus depot from which the buses are
assigned to different routes. The routes are cyclic which makes the re-deployment of a bus to
another route possible.

We hope that the simulation model will give us (and the decision makers) insights about
the level of complexity involved in the decision making process as well as a starting point as to
what to look into, and consider, in the event that the planners are looking to switch to a hybrid or
even a fully electric system.
