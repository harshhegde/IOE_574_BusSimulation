# IOE_574_BusSimulation
The aim of this project is to simulate the University bus (or M-Bus) system for the city of Ann Arbor using 4 different types of buses - conventional buses (liquid fuel based), all electric buses, and hybrid buses. We aim to aid the city planner in making a decision on which type of bus would be the most feasible for the given situation.
